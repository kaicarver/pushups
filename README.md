# pushups
Do more pushups: a web app to learn how to do 100 pushups :-)

This web app can be turned into a phone app for Android, iOS, or Windows with PhoneGap.
https://build.phonegap.com/

The app is currently under development, and serves as an example for an app-making class.

See the app in action here:
